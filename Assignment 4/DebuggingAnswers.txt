Put your answers to the debugging questions from Problem One in this file.

Q1:
finish: 'C' 67
numDisks 5 
start: 'A' 65
temp: 'B' 66
totalMoves: 3


Q2:
"solveTowersOfHanoi" was called by "makeTheMagicHappen()" function located in "TowersOfHanoiGUI.cpp" file.


Q3:
31 total moves were required to solve the instance of Towers of Hanoi.


Q4:
15 moves were made inside the first moveTower call after stepping over its first recursive sub-call.


Q5:
"ab" (string made up of any two characters) is the smallest possible input that triggers the bug in the Permutations.cpp


Q6:
Equal to (=) sign in chosen += ch is the one-character error in the program.


Q7:
With the following code: "chosen += ch", the chosen parameter gets updated and retains the "chosen" value from previous sub-recursive call.

For instance, when I entered "ab" as str: after executing the first sub-recursive call with remaining = "b" and ch = 'a', chosen becomes 'a'. 

This chosen's updated value is retained with 'a' when executing second sub-recursive call with remaining = "a", ch = 'b'. Hence, 2nd sub-recursive call parameters are: "a", "ab" (since chosen += ch is 'a' + 'b').
