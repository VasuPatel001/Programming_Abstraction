Q1:
First is the employee's likelihood to select a given shift by quantifying/ranking in linear scale(1-5). (Where 1 being least likely and 5 being most likely)
Second is employer's preference towards a shift by quantifying/ranking in linear scale (1-5).
This data can be gathered by conducting a survey with employee and employer.


Q2:
Earlier condition to select a shift: if ((! isOverlapWith(shift, selected)) && (usedHours + lengthOf(shift) <= totalHours))

Modified condition to select a shift: if ((! isOverlapWith(shift, selected)) && (usedHours + lengthOf(shift) <= totalHours) && ((employeePreference * employerPreference) > 15))



Q3:
Ranking from best to worst:
Schedule 2, 1, 3
I choose this order because, I used weighted approach to identify shift's value by following formula:
employee preference * employer preference.
Hence, schedule 2 has 9 value associated with it, followed by shift 1 & 3 having same of 8. However, I preferred a shift with high employee's preference.
